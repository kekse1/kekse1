## [**`count.php`**](https://github.com/kekse1/count.php/)
**`The best PHP counter script in the world!1`**

I really love it, so please give it a try! It even got a **CLI mode** (**C**onsole **L**ine **I**nterface)
to manage all the values etc. (in your file system) and also to view the current states.

Using the file system (but **not** a single file!) it's pretty efficient, and I made it **really** secure!
It has really many features and is highly customizable - even with extra config differences for each host,
which can be used in any amount.. and there's the configuration on the one hand, and on the other hand
there are many **`$_GET[]` parameters** to customize the output/drawing.

It supports both `text/plain` (or other mime/content types) and `image/*` drawing output.

The last feature I'd like to mention here is the (configurable) **`?text`** parameter to draw short text
strings instead of the counted values etc., e.g. to hide some info from automatic web crawlers/spiders/..
etc., e.g. when you want to present your eMail address or so, and scramble it a bit (see my address on my
[**`~impressum`**](https://kekse.biz/?~impressum) page, as an example 4u).

## [**`v4`**](https://github.com/kekse1/v4/)
This is the current API documentation (etc.) for my [**private** website project](https://kekse.biz/).
Maybe you'd also like to see [the **source code**](https://kekse.biz/?~sources)?
Or maybe you want to see [all **my github projects**](https://kekse.biz/?~projects) in my own overview? `^_^`

## [**`scripts`**](https://github.com/kekse1/scripts/)
Mostly [bash shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) **scripts** (some also for inclusion via `source`/`.`),
partially JavaScript (like my own [Reflect.clone()` function](https://github.com/kekse1/scripts/#clonejs) ,
 and maybe even more?

Here's also my notorious [**`$PS1`** prompt](https://github.com/kekse1/scripts/#promptsh) (including an
[example screenshot](https://github.com/kekse1/scripts/blob/master/img/prompt.png)).

## [**`getopt.js`**](https://github.com/kekse1/getopt.js/)
My own `getopt` interpretation, written in plain/vanilla JavaScript (in fact based upon my [**v4** **lib**/](#v4),
but you'll find a [**polyfill**](https://github.com/kekse1/getopt.js/blob/git/js/polyfill.js) there).

## [**`noto-emoji-animation`**](https://github.com/kekse1/noto-emoji-animation/)
Google got it's own animated icon set, available via web interface (and github, too):

* [**Google**: The hub for everything animated emoji!](https://googlefonts.github.io/noto-emoji-animation/)
* [**Google**: Github repository](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji)

I hacked out a **mass downloader** here, plus an additional **PHP interface**, and even more.
It should still work, but I'm not absolutely sure, since this project is some months old..

## [**`resize.php`**](https://github.com/kekse1/resize.php/)
Both for the **CLI** (**C**onsole **L**ine **I**nterface) and the **web browser** (so via **HTTPD**): a script
to resize images. Only **down**-scaling allowed, since **up**-scaling won't make any sense, for obvious reasons..

## [**`github-markdown.php`**](https://github.com/kekse1/github-markdown.php/)
A **PHP** script to convert **markdown to HTML** code, using the GitHub's API.

## [**`norbert`**](https://github.com/kekse1/norbert/)
Only some notes to my own A.I. I'm researching on for nearly twenty years now.. there's nothing to be downloaded
or so, it's just a remark that my own `Norbert` is somewhere out there.. **`^_^`**

## [**`v3`**](https://github.com/kekse1/v3/)
Basically only a screenshot left of my previous **v3** web design (the **private** one).
The code is deleted, since my newest [**v4**](#v4) is available right now.

## [**`lib.js`**](https://github.com/kekse1/lib.js/)
Only a memory of some older [**libjs.de**](https://libjs.de/) times.. the project ended some time ago, in it's
place now the newest [**v4**](#v4), respectively it's **`lib`/** part.
