## **`count.php`**
`The best PHP counter script in the world!1`

I really love it, so please give it a try! It even got a **CLI mode** (**C**onsole **L**ine **I**nterface)
to manage all the values etc. (in your file system) and also to view the current states.

Using the file system (but **not** a single file!) it's pretty efficient, and I made it **really** secure!
It has really many features and is highly customizable - even with extra config differences for each host,
which can be used in any amount.. and there's the configuration on the one hand (which can also be verified
in the **CLI mode** (via **`--config / -c`** parameter), and there are many **`$_GET[]` parameters** to
customize the output/drawing.

It supports both `text/plain` (or other mime types configurable) and `image/*` drawing output. And the last
feature I'd like to mention here is the (configurable) **`?text`** parameter to draw short text strings instead
of the counted values etc., e.g. to hide some info from automatic web crawlers/spiders/.. etc., e.g. when you
want to present your eMail address or so.

## **`v4`**
This is the current API documentation (etc.) for my [**private** website project](https://kekse.biz/).
Maybe you'd also like to see [the **source code**](https://kekse.biz/?~sources)?

## **`scripts`**
Mostly [bash shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) **scripts** (some also for inclusion via `source`/`.`),
partially JavaScript (like my own [Reflect.clone()` function](https://github.com/kekse1/scripts/#clonejs) ,
 and maybe even more?

Here's also [my **notorious `$PS`** prompt](https://github.com/kekse1/scripts/#promptsh) to be found (including an
[example screenshot](https://github.com/kekse1/scripts/blob/master/img/prompt.png).

## **`getopt.js`**
My own `getopt` interpretation, written in plain/vanilla JavaScript. I think it's a really nice design,
but **one bug** left/found in there (when handling multiple parameters).. I'd love to get a bugfix by you.

## **`noto-emoji-animation`**
Google got it's own animated icon set, available via web interface (and github, too):

* [**Google**: The hub for everything animated emoji!](https://googlefonts.github.io/noto-emoji-animation/)
* [**Google**: Github repository](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji)

I hacked out a **mass downloader** here, plus an additional **PHP interface**, and maybe even more. It should
still work, but I'm not absolutely sure, since this project is some months old..

## **`resize.php`**
Both for the **CLI** (**C**onsole **L**ine **I**nterface) and the **web browser** (so via **HTTPD**): a script
to resize images. Only **down**-scaling allowed, since **up**-scaling wouldn't make any sense..

## **`github-markdown.php`**
A **PHP** script to convert **markdown to HTML** code, using the GitHub's API.

## **`norbert`**
Only some notes to my own A.I. I'm researching on for almost twenty years now.. there's nothing to be downloaded
or so, it's just a remark that my own `Norbert` is somewhere out there.. **`^_^`**

## **`v3`**
Basically only a screenshot left of my previous **v3** web design (my private one). The code is deleted, since
my newest [**v4**](#v4) is available right now.

## **`lib.js`**
Only a memory of some older [**libjs.de**](https://libjs.de/) times.. the project ended some time ago, in it's
place now the newest [**v4**](#v4), respectively it's **`lib`/** part.
